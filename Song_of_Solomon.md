# Song of Solomon
The Song of Solomon is one example which has been brought up as I read as an example of the Bible actually glorifying two individuals having premarital sex, contrary to the common message presented by many other bible verses and as a common interpretation by Christians. I have decided to read through this and decide for myself how I believe this poem should be interpreted.

## Into his chambers
[Song of Solomon 1:2-4]
``` 
2   Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
    For your love is better than wine;
3       your anointing oils are fragrant;
    your name is oil poured out;
        therefore virgins love you.
4   Draw me after you; let us run.
        The king has brought me into his chambers.
```

## Graze among the lilies
[Song of Solomon 2:16-17]
```
16  My beloved is mine, and I am his;
        he grazes among the lilies.
17  Until the day breathes
        and the shadows flee,
    turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle
        or a young stag on cleft mountains.
```

The image of this verse alludes to sex, and this is enforced by looking at the other language surrounding it, where the woman says the following of herself:
[Song of Solomon 2:1]
```
1   I am a rose of Sharon,
        a lily of the valleys.
```
And of the man, she says:
[Song of Solomon 2:9]
```
9   My beloved is like a gazelle
        or a young stag.
    Behold, there he stands
        behind our wall,
    gazing through the windows,
        looking through the lattice.
